# NOTES

## Setup

1. Navigate to data folder, run yarn, then run yarn start
2. Navigate to server folder, run yarn, then run yarn start
3. Navigate to the client folder, run yarn, then run yarn start
4. Wait for the site to open in your browser

## Notes

- Simple responsive app showcasing my use of react, redux, testing, and apollo
- Server is just a rough draft to aid the client so should not be taken seriously
- Avatar images might not longer exist on the amazon CDN
